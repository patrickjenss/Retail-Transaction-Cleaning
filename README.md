🛍️ Retail Sales Data Cleaning & Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on data cleaning and exploratory analysis of a retail store sales dataset.
The dataset contains 12,575 transactions with features such as product details, customer information, and transaction dates.

The main goal is to ensure data quality by handling missing values, removing inconsistencies, and preparing the dataset for further business analysis or machine learning tasks.

🧹 Data Cleaning Process

Handling missing values (transaction dates, customer IDs, and product details).

Removing duplicates and correcting inconsistent formats.

Feature engineering:

Extracting transaction month and day from dates.

Creating new features for better time-based analysis.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Monthly sales trends.

Distribution of transactions across product categories.

Customer purchase patterns.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Jupyter Notebook

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

🚀 Key Insights

Missing values can significantly impact retail sales analysis if not handled carefully.

Feature engineering (month, day extraction) helps uncover seasonality in transactions.

Clean data is the foundation for accurate business insights and machine learning readiness.

📌 Future Improvements

Automate cleaning pipeline using Python scripts.

Build interactive dashboard (Tableau / Power BI).

Apply predictive models for sales forecasting.
